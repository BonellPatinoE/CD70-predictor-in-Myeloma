Machine learning analysis for transcriptional regulation of CD70 expression in multiple myeloma patient samples in the pre-print: Targeting high-risk multiple myeloma genotypes with optimized anti-CD70 CAR-T cells. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.24.581875. https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.24.581875v1

Patient transcriptomic data were acquired from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass dataset (IA19). A list of 84 transcription factors was generated for this analysis by combining those from ATAC-seq motif analysis of MM patient tumors with analysis of ENCODE and PROMO data suggesting binding of different transcription factors to the CD70 locus in plasma cells. CD138+ enriched RNA-Seq data from 928 MM patients was incorporated into the model. All counts (in Transcripts per Million (TPM)) were log-transformed prior to model building and analysis. We developed an XGBoost model (Extreme Gradient Boosting) using the xgboost package in Python. We used a randomized search with cross-validation to find the best parameters for the XGBoost models to predict CD70 expression.
